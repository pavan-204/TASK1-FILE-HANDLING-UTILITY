COMPANY: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCEIPTION: As part of my 4-week Java Programming internship at Codetech IT Solutions under the guidance of my mentor Neela Santhosh, I was assigned Task 1: File Handling Utility. This task focused on creating a Java program capable of performing basic file operations — writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying an existing file by appending new content. The objective was to build a script demonstrating these essential file handling operations while ensuring clean, readable code with appropriate documentation and comments for better understanding and future reference.

To complete this task, I chose BlueJ as my primary code editor. BlueJ is a user-friendly, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for teaching and learning Java programming. It offers a clean interface with a simple project structure, making it ideal for small- to medium-sized Java projects. Its built-in compiler, editor, object bench, and terminal window allowed me to write, compile, run, and test my Java programs efficiently within a single environment.

For compiling and executing the program, I used Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21, which is the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) release from Oracle. The JDK was configured with BlueJ by specifying the path to the installed Java version within the BlueJ settings, ensuring the program could be compiled and executed without compatibility issues.

In order to better understand Java’s file handling mechanism, I referred to several reliable open-source documentation and tutorials. The official Oracle Java Documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html) served as a primary reference, providing detailed information about the java.io and java.nio.file packages, and various classes such as FileWriter, FileReader, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and Scanner. Additionally, I consulted articles and code samples from open-source educational platforms like GeeksforGeeks, W3Schools, and JavaPoint. These resources offered practical examples and use cases of file operations, which helped me structure and test my program effectively.

The program was designed in a modular way, with three dedicated methods: writeFile(), readFile(), and modifyFile(). Each method performs a specific operation while handling exceptions to ensure the program runs smoothly without abrupt termination. Comments were added throughout the code to explain the purpose of each block and line, making it easier for other developers or students to understand the logic.

A Scanner object was used to accept dynamic user inputs from the terminal window within BlueJ, enabling the program to interactively write and append content to a text file named example.txt. After every write or modify operation, the content of the file was displayed on the terminal to verify the changes in real-time. The program was tested multiple times with different inputs to validate its accuracy, efficiency, and correctness.

To enhance my efficiency and clarify certain syntax-related doubts, I occasionally sought minor assistance from OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The AI-based tool was particularly useful in confirming Java syntax conventions and suggesting clean coding practices. However, the core development, logic structuring, and program implementation were completed manually using the aforementioned open-source documentation and educational resources.

In conclusion, this file handling task significantly improved my practical knowledge of Java’s file input/output operations. It also enhanced my ability to work with external files effectively in a structured, error-free manner. Additionally, this project familiarized me with modern Java development practices using BlueJ and various open-source resources. The task has served as a valuable foundational exercise for developing more complex file-based applications in future academic and professional projects.
